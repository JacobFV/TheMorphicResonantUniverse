- From the primordial to the conscious
- Consciousness emerges from subconscious
- Measured quantum events from the underlying quantum field

The univese is a system of emergent order from primordial fields of potentiality. The human brains exploit this potentiality field with their terahertz oscillating microtubules to create stable cognitive dynamics (thoughts) from the underlying nondeterminite QFT fields but the Universe also does something similar when it crystalizes the chaotic quantum foam into deterministic classical physiscs. Physicss can therefore be viewed as the lnguage of cosmic consiousness.

Now consciousness sitss on the edge of stability (slightly sub-critical during waking states). Is there a correllate of that in the universe? Well consider the brownian motion of a particle in a box. Depending on the dimensionality (degees of freedom, ergo the level of disorderliness) of the thermodynaic state space that it moves in, it may or may not return to the same state. 3 is the edge of chaos for brownian dynamics.  So perhaps the universe is 3 dimensional in the places we observe order because that is the maximum degee of freedom that does not give rise to chaos. Chaos on the QFT foam? IDK.
