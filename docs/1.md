# The Living Universe

- The living universe paradigm I am about to present to you will differfrom many mainstream interpretations of physics and cosmology.
  - We currently understand much of nature through mechanistic materialism
  - Certainly reductionism --as human consciousness knows it-- is useful for seeing beneath the direct observables of nature to inferring the underlying structures governing reality
    - more points on mechanistic materialism
  - Negative aspects
    - myopic manner
    - enframing
    - ... [copy formscape intro from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kYL5BaqpSg&t=236s]
  - Moreover, mechanistic materialism fails to explain the most basic given of reality: consciousness
    - Consciousness is the one certainty of our own existence. Everything else could be a misunderstanding, but consciousness or knownledge with one's own self is ontologically bound to one's own self and therefore cannot even be approached without already possessing it.
- Consciousness gains information from the action of observation
- The fundamental stuff of concrete reality is ultimately some form of information
- The undiferentiated symmetric morphological space
- Meaasurement induced symmetry breaking collapses this space into measurement groups

- intelligence is not about resonating with the concrete past, but being attuned to unemasred vibrations from the future

- Free will
  - The universe wants to minimize information
  - This usually entails minimizing morphological complexity
    - but not entirely from blind entropy; also from morphic resonance
- The universe
