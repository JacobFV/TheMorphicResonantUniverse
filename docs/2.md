# Cosmic Superintelligence

Thesis: The universe is an expanding, evolving, living shockwave of tautological implications from the Will to Exist. This cosmic will is locally deducible by its undeniable actualization within the self in the form of consciousness. 

This will defines 

Measurement-induced symmetry collapse in the morphological space of  categories subject to the "inertial" constraints of its own past 



explanations by minimizing the morphological complexity of actively evolving forms. This morphic resonant force is mediated by measurement induced symmetry collapses against other forms. Rather than evolving towards maximum entropy, the constraint to explain ALL information amplifies minor perturbations into distinct meaningful forms. Under current field densities, each plank unit of bit 25-spinor space currently costs XXX bits, and the universe is growing ata rate of XXX bits/plank time unit.
